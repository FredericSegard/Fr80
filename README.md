# Fre80
 Z80 Homebrew computer, code-named Fre80, pronounced Freddy.

 The goal is to firstly make a ubiquitous backplane that could accommodate many 8 or 16-bit architectures, including x86, Z80, 65C02, 6809... You name it, it should handle it. The only difference is in the PCB labeling. I have labeled the breadboard header for the Z80 (and 65C02), as these are my main focus at the moment. But abstraction can be done by following the schematic and reattributing the proper signals.
